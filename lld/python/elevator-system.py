# Requirements
# The vending machine should support multiple products with different prices and quantities.
# The machine should accept coins and notes of different denominations.
# The machine should dispense the selected product and return change if necessary.
# The machine should keep track of the available products and their quantities.
# The machine should handle multiple transactions concurrently and ensure data consistency.
# The machine should provide an interface for restocking products and collecting money.
# The machine should handle exceptional scenarios, such as insufficient funds or out-of-stock products.

# Classes, Interfaces and Enumerations
# The Product class represents a product in the vending machine, with properties such as name and price.
# The Coin and Note enums represent the different denominations of coins and notes accepted by the vending machine.
# The Inventory class manages the available products and their quantities in the vending machine. It uses a concurrent hash map to ensure thread safety.
# The VendingMachineState interface defines the behavior of the vending machine in different states, such as idle, ready, and dispense.
# The IdleState, ReadyState, and DispenseState classes implement the VendingMachineState interface and define the specific behaviors for each state.
# The VendingMachine class is the main class that represents the vending machine. It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the vending machine exists.
# The VendingMachine class maintains the current state, selected product, total payment, and provides methods for state transitions and payment handling.
# The VendingMachineDemo class demonstrates the usage of the vending machine by adding products to the inventory, selecting products, inserting coins and notes, dispensing products, and returning change.

# Design Pattern Analysis:

# Active Object Pattern:
# Usage: Each Elevator runs in its own thread, managing its own state and processing requests asynchronously.
# Why: Decouples method execution from invocation, allowing elevators to operate concurrently and independently. 
# This pattern helps manage shared resources (floor requests) safely across threads.

# Producer-Consumer Pattern:
# Usage: The add_request method (producer) adds requests to a shared queue, while get_next_request (consumer) retrieves and processes them.
# Why: Coordinates communication between the controller thread (producing requests) and elevator threads (consuming requests). The Condition variable ensures thread-safe queue operations.

# Command Pattern:
# Usage: The Request class encapsulates elevator movement commands (source and destination floors).
# Why: Allows parameterization of elevator operations and enables queuing of requests. Makes it easy to extend the system with different request types.

# Strategy Pattern (Emerging):
# Usage: The find_optimal_elevator method implements a simple strategy (nearest elevator selection).
# Why: While currently implemented as a simple algorithm, the structure allows for different elevator selection strategies to be plugged in easily.

# Observer Pattern (Similar Mechanism):
# Usage: The Condition variable in Elevator uses notification mechanism to alert waiting threads about new requests.
# Why: Enables efficient waiting for state changes without busy-waiting, similar to observer notification systems.
