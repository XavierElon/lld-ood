# Explanation of Design Patterns
# Singleton Pattern (HotelManagementSystem)
# What: Ensures that only one instance of the HotelManagementSystem class can exist at a time.
# Why: In a hotel management context, you generally want a single point of reference to the system that tracks all reservations, rooms, and guests.

# Strategy Pattern (Payment Interface)
# What: Provides a family of interchangeable algorithms (payment methods) for performing the same task (processing payment).
# Why: This allows adding new payment methods (e.g., PayPal, mobile wallets) without modifying existing code. Each payment method implements the process_payment method differently.
# Additional potential patterns could be introduced (e.g., a Factory to create different kinds of Room objects), but in its current state, the most evident patterns are Singleton and Strategy.

# Explanation of Object-Oriented Principles
# Encapsulation
# Example: The Room class encapsulates its status and lock. Methods like book(), check_in(), and check_out() manage how the status changes.
# Why: Prevents direct access to internal data, ensuring the status transitions are always valid and thread-safe.

# # Abstraction
# Example: The Payment class is an abstract base class that defines an interface for process_payment.
# Why: Hides the details of each payment method, allowing the system to handle any payment object that implements the Payment interface.

# Inheritance
# Example: CashPayment and CreditCardPayment both inherit from the abstract class Payment.
# Why: Allows code reusability and the extension of the Payment interface for specific payment methods.

# Polymorphism
# Example: The process_payment method can be called on any Payment subclass (CashPayment, CreditCardPayment, etc.), and it will execute the subclass-specific logic.
# Why: Improves flexibility, letting the system handle various payment types without knowing their internal details.

# Thread Safety
# Example: The Lock objects in Room and in the HotelManagementSystem help ensure that operations on shared state (like changing a roomâ€™s status or adding reservations) are safe in a multi-threaded environment.
# Why: Concurrency control prevents race conditions and inconsistent data.
# Overall, this system design aims to be scalable and maintainable by following solid OOP principles and employing well-known design patterns.
