Behavioral Design Patterns focus on communication and interaction between objects. They define how objects distribute responsibilities and communicate with each other. These patterns help manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects. Think of them as the "communication protocols" between objects - they establish patterns for how objects should talk to and work with each other.
Creational Design Patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. They help make systems independent of how their objects are created, composed, and represented. These patterns provide flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created under which circumstances. They essentially abstract away the instantiation process - rather than creating objects directly, these patterns help you delegate and control object creation.
Structural Design Patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that when parts of a system change, the entire system doesn't need to change. These patterns show how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Think of them as recipes for how to build and combine objects to form robust and flexible components.
A simple analogy: If we compare software to building a house:

Creational patterns are like the rules for setting up a construction site and gathering materials
Structural patterns are like the blueprints for how to put those materials together
Behavioral patterns are like the guidelines for how the rooms and utilities should interact with each other
